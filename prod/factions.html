        <p>The night the heavens split, a shard from the Big Dipper tore through the firmament and fell screaming into the world. Where it struck, matter unraveled—steel quivered like breath, oceans turned to ink, and the air itself felt aware. In the wake of that starfall, dormant horrors woke within humanity’s own scars: the long-faded echoes of pandemics, twisted by cosmic radiation into an infection that did not simply sicken bodies—it rewrote behavior.</p>
        <p>Doctor Boon was one of the first to see the pattern. While the city panicked, he studied telemetry: hospital charts scrolling into disturbing symmetry, victims marching through identical compulsions—collect, hoard, mimic, converge. This was not madness. It was instruction. And instructions could be hacked.</p>
        <p>Boon gathered a circle of engineers, couriers, and broken medics who refused to yield. They became the Freeborn, a resistance that prized ingenuity over numbers, improvisation over obedience. In the gutted labs of an abandoned university, Boon improvised weapons of thought and biology—countermeasures that fought the shard on its own terms.</p>
        <p>His first masterpiece was the Neural Halo, a circlet of biofiber and resonant crystal that could overlay the brain with interference patterns. When worn, it gave the infected clarity for minutes at a time—enough to escape, to fight, to remember who they were. The shard commanded, but the Halo whispered back: you are still you.</p>
        <p>Then came the Stellar Splicer, a relic assembled from collapsed satellite arrays. It cut fragments of cosmic radiation into usable spectra, weaving beams of impossible light that could burn contagion from air itself. The Freeborn used it to clear districts for brief windows of safety, sanctuaries carved from chaos. Survivors called its light “borrowed stars,” proof that even in ruin, humanity could steal power back from the heavens.</p>
        <p>The Freeborn’s greatest test came at the Glass Aqueduct, where tens of thousands moved as one, compelled to converge on the crater’s horizon. Boon deployed Halos to break the pattern, then deliberately overloaded the Splicer to scatter fragments of stellar light across the aqueduct’s arches. For a heartbeat the sequence faltered, and the crowd awakened. Some screamed. Others wept. But for the first time, the infection had been denied.</p>
        <p>That night, beneath auroras of teal and purple where the shard’s wake scraped the sky, Boon recorded his creed: “Tactics are not war. They are survival extended by wit. We will not outnumber the shard, nor outgun it. But we can outthink it. The Freeborn exist to prove choice is stronger than sequence.”</p>
        <p>The city whispered his name as a rumor, then a rallying cry. In a world of compulsion, Doctor Boon had made defiance into doctrine. And where the Freeborn marched, humanity remembered it was still free.</p>

        <p>High Priestess Nyra, guardian of the ancient fire altars, heard the call of the celestial shard as it ignited sacred embers deep within the volcanic peaks. From the heart of the Ember Crown, she felt the shard’s pulse awaken something older than memory — a will of flame, divine and alive.</p>
        <p>Channeling the Elemental Flame, Nyra sought not conquest but cleansing. To her, the world’s corruption was not to be punished, but purified. Fire was not an ending — it was transformation. Each inferno she summoned was a ritual, a prayer made visible, burning away the sickness that had taken root in the hearts of humankind.</p>
        <p>To the uninitiated, her flames looked like apocalypse. Cities reduced to cinders. Forests turned to ash. Yet in the silence after the blaze, life returned — stronger, untainted, reborn. Her followers saw it clearly. Every spark carried the promise of renewal. Every ember whispered that destruction was merely the soil from which creation would rise again.</p>
        <p>Under her guidance, the Flameborn rose — torchbearers of faith and fear alike. They moved through the dying world with light in their hands, their crimson robes flickering in the wind. Some called them zealots, others saviors. But to Nyra, only the path mattered.</p>
        <p>And so, upon the highest altar of the Ember Crown, she vowed — “Let the world be remade through sacred flame. Let all corruption burn, and from its ashes, rise anew.”</p>

        <p>Deep in the heart of primeval forests, Virelia, a spirit-bonded warrior, communed with the ancient roots of the earth. As the infection spread, nature itself cried out in pain. Virelia fused her flame-touched powers with the will of the forest to create living sanctuaries, places where the infection could not reach.</p>
        <p>Her alliance, the Cradle of the Root, stood as the last bastion of balance between nature and fire — not conquest, but renewal through growth and guardianship.</p>
